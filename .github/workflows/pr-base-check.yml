            const message = `ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 

            It looks like this PR is targeting the \`main\` branch. To help maintain our development workflow, please change the base reference to \`next\` instead.

            __If this is a bug fix that requires a patch release __ (e.g., a critical bug that needs to be fixed before the next release)__, please leave the base branch as \`main\`.__

            You can change this by:
            1. Clicking the "Edit" button next to the PR title
            2. Changing the base branch from \`main\` to \`next\`
            3. Clicking "Update pull request"

            Thanks for your contribution! ðŸš€`;
